# Competitive Programming

Collection of all the competitive programming competitions I partook in.

### [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/)/[SpOJ](https://www.spoj.com/)/[Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

Collections of C++ exercises, as these platforms evaluate performance, therefore the language's powerful Standard Library proves highly useful.

### [Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/)

Google's Hash Code is a team programming competition for both students and professionals around the world.

### [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev)

Fun website to train CSS skills, however, do not expect to use these on your day to day CSS, as correctness is not required, and the real purpose is minification. These are mostly one-liners and I might not explain all problems, just the ones that are mainly optimization.

### [Advents of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

The only Advent calendar I pay attention to. Every year I try a different language, but I don't promise to finish it as sometimes the time restraints are just too tight.

## About

The solutions implemented are my own and they are often a product of quick thinking and coding. I do not intend to make the best code in terms of 'quality', but I intend to have clean solutions that can be interpreted by someone other than me, however, my main objectives are solve the problems as quickly and as efficiently as required, so beware.
