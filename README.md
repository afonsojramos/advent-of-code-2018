# Competitive Programming

Collection of all the competitive programming competitions I partook in.

### [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/) [ðŸ’»](https://github.com/afonsojramos/competitive-programming/tree/master/csacademy) /[SpOJ](https://www.spoj.com/) [ðŸ’»](https://github.com/afonsojramos/competitive-programming/tree/master/spoj) /[Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) [ðŸ’»](https://github.com/afonsojramos/competitive-programming/tree/master/hacker-rank)

Collections of C++ exercises, as these platforms evaluate performance, therefore the language's powerful Standard Library proves highly useful.

### [Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/) [ðŸ’»](https://github.com/afonsojramos/competitive-programming/tree/master/hash-code)

Google's Hash Code is a team programming competition for both students and professionals around the world.

### [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev) [ðŸ’»](https://github.com/afonsojramos/competitive-programming/tree/master/css-battle)

Fun website to train CSS skills, however, do not expect to use these on your day-to-day CSS, as correctness is not required, and the real purpose is minification. These are mostly one-liners, and I might not explain all problems, just the ones that are mainly optimization.

### [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [ðŸ’»](https://github.com/afonsojramos/competitive-programming/tree/master/advent-of-code)

The only Advent calendar I pay attention to. Every year I try a different language, but I don't promise to finish it as sometimes the time restraints are just too tight.

## About

The solutions implemented are my own. They are often a product of quick thinking and coding. The objective will always be to have overfitted code for each challenge as quickly and efficiently as possible; therefore, code quality will not be the main focus. However, I intend to have clean solutions that can be interpreted by someone other than me.
