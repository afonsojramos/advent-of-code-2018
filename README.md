🎄 My submissions for this year's Advent of Code using Golang 🎁🎅

**[Go Guide Me!](https://github.com/afonsojramos/advent-of-code-2018/blob/master/go-guide.md)** 

## Advent of Code
From the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) page:

*"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."*

## Why Golang
I've seen Golang being used in a lot of big projects, and since I've never programmed in Go I've decided to learn it! If you want to learn it too, I'm compiling a **[small introductory guide](https://github.com/afonsojramos/advent-of-code-2018/blob/master/go-guide.md)** for it!

## Disclaimer
These solutions may be poorly implemented since I'm still learning how to use this language, but I expect an improvement over time. Furthermore, I do not have much free time, so some solutions might seem rushed. Still, I'll try to keep it clean.
